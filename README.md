#What is ClearVoltex?

ClearVoltex is an web application for users to track their clear and score tags for the game Sound Voltex, an arcade game developed by Konami.

#Why create such tool?

Back in SDVX II, there was http://sdvx-level.github.io/ which allowed users to keep track of their clears without any payment. This application has not been updated for past 4 years, so I decided to personally develop a web application that uses the ideas from original application, plus adding more features.
