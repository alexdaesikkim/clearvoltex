#Created by Alex Kim

http://sdvx-level.github.io/ haven't been updated since release of SDVX 2, so I decided to make my own version of the app using Ruby on Rails. For now, this is documentation for personal work only, and will update to show relevant changes within the application. May go open source once things really start picking up.

Note to self: This page is to serve as personal notes + some things that may be posted in public README.md. Please change README.md once repo becomes public.
